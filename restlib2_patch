This is a patch for one of the libraries installed in
your virtual environment that ehb_service uses. The library is restlib2,
and we need to fix the init file in the http folder.

Step 1. Locate that file on your local, the path should look similar to this:
/Users/yournameorusername/.virtualenvs/service/lib/python2.7/site-packages/restlib2/http

Step 2. Delete all the code in the file.

Step 3. Replace with the following code:

#### BEGINNING OF REPLACEMENT CODE FOR restlib2/http/init.py ######

import httplib
from restlib2.structures import AttrDict

httplib.responses[422] = 'UNPROCESSABLE ENTITY'

# http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6585
httplib.responses[428] = 'PRECONDITION REQUIRED'
httplib.responses[429] = 'TOO MANY REQUESTS'
httplib.responses[431] = 'REQUEST HEADER FIELDS TOO LARGE'
httplib.responses[511] = 'NETWORK AUTHENTICATION REQUIRED'

# http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-tbray-http-legally-restricted-status-02
httplib.responses[451] = 'UNAVAILABLE FOR LEGAL REASONS'


# Invert dict for reference by name
codes = AttrDict('HTTP Status Codes',
                 [(y, x) for x, y in httplib.responses.items()])


# PATCH Method introduced - http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5789
methods = AttrDict('HTTP Methods',
                   GET = 'GET',
                   HEAD = 'HEAD',
                   OPTIONS = 'OPTIONS',
                   POST = 'POST',
                   PUT = 'PUT',
                   DELETE = 'DELETE',
                   PATCH = 'PATCH',
                   )
